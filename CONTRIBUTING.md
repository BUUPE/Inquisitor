# Contributing to Inquisitor
Before contributing, note that we use the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. Please read that article in its entirety if you are unfamiliar with the concept. Also, if you don't have the bindings installed already, please [install them](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation). If you need a quick refresher on Git Flow, check out this [cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/). If you haven't already done so, run `git flow init -d` in the project root. This will setup your local repository to match the branching model of the remote (`master` and `develop` with feature branches etc.). Make sure you follow the Git Flow model when making any features/changes (you won't have access to push changes directly to `master` or `develop` anyways). Furthermore, before making any changes to the repository, set up [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) on your machine/editor. This will help maintain code style throughout the project.

As a reminder, this project uses the [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) design library, so try to use it as much as possible to ensure a uniform look throughout the app and to prevent reinventing the wheel too often. Reading through the list of available components would be a good first step.

Otherwise, check out the issues and take one that's unassigned! If you have any questions, please reach out to @ROODAY or @Warren-Partridge.
